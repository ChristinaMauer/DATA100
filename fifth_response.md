# Fifth and Final Response

Overall, Data Science gives Data Scientists a lot of information to work with. Based on that information, they can try to predict the behaviour of other similar systems, which can
often lead to a greater understanding of both.

Data is being generated in real or near-real time. It is flexible by adding new fields and explanding in size. Much of the data is generated without a specific purpose in mind 
at first. Big Data doesn't use theories and tests it on the data. Instead it gains insights from the data itself. This allows scientists of any discipline to mine through data 
for patterns instead of proposing a hypothesis first. Based on this, it is easy to argue that the scientific method is no longer needed. This is sometimes called the fourth 
paradigm of science.

West argues against this. He says that in order to know which data is revelant and which aren't, we need a theoretical framework to understand it. He stated big data is less 
of the fourth paradigm shift and more of paradigm 3.1

Based on factual information found in Big Data, social sciences scholars could develop better models for human life. The models become more complex as the scarcity of information 
decreases. Models can be produced with greater depth, scale and breadth, better than what we have today. It's also possible to test theories across many situations and places. 
With more knowledge and insight into human life, it will become easier to identify and face the issues humankind have.

A very good example would be international aid. International development can be aided through the correct use of big data. The models could make it easier to identify those in 
need by analysing patterns. It would be easier to match resources to people living in poverty. It would also make it easier for charity organizations to destribute aid to them. It 
might also soon be possible to track problems, such as pandemics or natural disasters, using phone data. Improved tracking leads to an improved response to such disasters.

The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Good intent is not nearly enough. The largest data gatherers are private companies, where profit is the main concern. The 
data could end up on the wrong place (ahem, advertisements). Improving transparency would lessen the opportunities for bad intent.

Big Data enhances the amount of data available for humanities research. The analysis methods used in science isn't viable when it comes to the humanities, because it removes 
the research from its context and only sees data. Humans are a lot more complicated. Their behaviour can not easily be determined by logically analysing data. As such, a mix of 
Big Data and old techniques can pave the way for data science and the humanities, like West suggested.
