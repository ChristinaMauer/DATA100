Scaling from small to large is accompanied by a change from simplicity to complexity, but the building blocks remain the same. In West's book, he compared a house to a 
skyscraper. The skyscraper is much larger and complex, but still uses the same principles of design and construction. 
Cities scale as a function of population. The bigger the city, the fewer roads, electrical cables and water pipes needed. Conversely, the larger the city, the higher the wages, 
wealth, violent crime and educational institutions. 
West states that companies also follow sub-linear scaling, with a factor 0f 0.9. A larger company produces fewer profits per capita.

West says that in order to know which data is revelant and which aren't, we need a theoretical framework to understand it. He stated big data is less of the fourth paradigm shift
and more of paradigm 3.1. He uses the Large Hadron Collider as an example. It generates 150 exabites a day. Finding the Higgs mechanism in all that data would be like looking for
a needle in an extremely large haystack. Only about 0.00001 percent of the data generated was relevant to the Higgs mechanism.
