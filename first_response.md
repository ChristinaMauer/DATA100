# Informal Response 1

International development can be aided through the correct use of big data. The data could make it easier to identify those in need by analysing patterns. It would be easier to 
match resources to people living in poverty. It would also make it easier for charity organizations to destribute aid to them. It might also soon be possible to track problems, 
such as pandemics or natural disasters, using phone data. Improved tracking leads to an improved response to such disasters.

Such benefits also come with risks. While loans could be given to more people who need them, it's not guaranteed that the loans would help. Loans could possibly trap people in
inescapable debt or poverty cycles. Not all understand the terms of the loans they take, and could be tricked into a bad deal. Further, a system of government could misuse the
big data by reducing the benefits to its citizens based on their digital footprint. Another risk is that the tools developed from big data will be deployed before being tested
thoroughly. The world is diverse, after all, and patterns in one country might not correlate to the patterns in another. Assuming they do could lead to heavy mistakes. It's also
very easy for the data to become outdated very quickly. There are people who will no doubt try to cheat the system by making themselves appear like the needy in order to reap the
benefits. Additionally, if data is only collected through items the the poor are less likely to have, such as smart phones, the poor will not be accurately represented in the 
results.

There are ways to mitigate the risks. Comparing the digital from phones to survey data is not only a good way to ensure accuracy, but also to refine the method used in gathering 
phone data. Developing an algorithm that takes local context into account before making decisions would help. If data gathering technology was implemented in areas that could 
otherwise not afford it, the groups living there would be less underrepresented.

I agree that good intent is not enough. The largest data gatherers are private companies, where profit is the main concern. The data could end up on the wrong place. Improving
transparency would lessen the opportunities for bad intent.
