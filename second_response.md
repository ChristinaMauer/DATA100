# Informal Response 2

Big Data is being generated in real or near-real time. It is flexible by adding new fields and explanding in size. Much of the data is generated without a specific purpose in mind 
at first. Big Data doesn't use theories and tests it on the data. Instead it gains insights from the data itself. This allows scientists of any discipline to mine through data for 
patterns instead of proposing a hypothesis first. Based on this, it is easy to argue that the scientific method is no longer needed. 

Based on factual information found in Big Data, social sciences scholars could develop better models for human life. The models become more complex as the scarcity of information 
decreases. Models can be produced with greater depth, scale and breadth, better than what we have today. It's also possible to test theories across many situations and places. 
With more knowledge and insight into human life, it will become easier to identify and face the issues humankind have.

Big Data enhances the amount of data available for humanities research. The analysis methods used in science isn't viable when it comes to the humanities, because it removes the 
research from its context and only sees data. Humans are a lot more complicated. Their behaviour can not easily be determined by logically analysing data. As such, a mix of Big 
Data and "old" techniques can pave the way for data science and the humanities.
