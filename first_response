# Informal Response 1

International development can be aided through the correct use of big data. The data could make it easier to identify those in need by analysing patterns. It would be easier to 
match resources to people living in poverty. It would also make it easier for charity organizations to destribute aid to them. It might also soon be possible to track problems, 
such as pandemics or natural disasters, using phone data. Improved tracking leads to an improved response to such disasters.

Such benefits also come with risks. While loans could be given to more people who need them, it's not guaranteed that the loans would help. Loans could possibly trap people in
inescapable debt or poverty cycles. Not all understand the terms of the loans they take, and could be tricked into a bad deal. Further, a system of government could misuse the
big data by reducing the benefits to its citizens based on their digital footprint.
