# Informal Response 1

International development can be aided through the correct use of big data. The data could make it easier to identify those in need by analysing patterns. It would be easier to 
match resources to people living in poverty. It would also make it easier for charity organizations to destribute aid to them. It might also soon be possible to track problems, 
such as pandemics or natural disasters, using phone data. Improved tracking leads to an improved response to such disasters.
