# Question 1
He argues that development is a property of the social and economic system. 

# Question 2
The toaster project was an attempt by Thomas Thwaites to build a toaster from scratch by himself, using raw materials. He was successful for only five seconds, until the toaster
caught on fire. It shows that even making a toaster is a difficult task requiring a variety of things. Development doesn't require an increase in only one firm, but a system of 
many firms and institutions which provide the citizens with all they desire.

# Question 3
They weren't very good. He believes that every model created states thta all models before them were worng and that something is missing.

# Question 4
He is now an evolutionary biologist, but at the time he was working at a factory to design a nozzle for them. He took the one they had, made ten copies, tweaked the each of the 
copies in a different way, then tested which of the copies was the most effective. He took the most effective designin, and repeated the process. After fourty-five generations, the
nozzle he designed worked considerably better than the one he started out with. It showed that adaptation is better than trying to design the perfect item from scratch.

# Question 5
It's a system of interactions between many adaptive agants that evolve together. The details are difficult to predict, but predictions of the system as a whole is possible. They 
have patterns that aren't linked to any one agent. They tend towards greater complexity and not towards an equilibrium. 

# Question 6
He was the last of Ethiopia's great fuedal dynasty. The emperor was the only one who made decisions. The system suppressed any efforts to change the system to be more inclusive, 
since it would threaten the positions of those in power.

# Question 7
He argues that it is difficult to engineer solutions in a complex adaptive system. It's hard to predict what implications a change will have. He means that it is easier for 
institutions to adopt the look of a functioning institution without actually being a functioning institution.

# Question 8
He means we shouldn't just accept the results of evolution and instead actively try to shape evolution our way. Normand Borlaug developed high yield, disease resistant wheat and 
brought about the green revolution.
